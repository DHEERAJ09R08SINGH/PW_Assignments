    "### Q1.What is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### What is Multithreading in Python?\n",
    "Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. A thread is the smallest unit of a process and represents a separate path of execution. Multithreading allows a program to perform multiple operations simultaneously, improving efficiency and performance, especially for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is Multithreading Used?\n",
    "(i)Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, improving the responsiveness and efficiency of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)I/O-Bound Operations: It is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations (e.g., file I/O, network communication) where threads can perform tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii)Improved Responsiveness: In GUI applications, multithreading can keep the interface responsive while performing background operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv)Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, making data sharing between threads more straightforward than inter-process communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Module Used to Handle Threads in Python\n",
    "The threading module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Example of Using the threading Module\n",

    "(iii)No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them; they must be released voluntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iv)Circular Wait: There exists a set of threads such that each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the set, forming a circular chain."
