    "### What is Abstraction in OOP?\n",
    "Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. Abstraction helps in reducing complexity, improving code readability, and enhancing maintainability by providing a clear separation between an object's interface and its implementation."

    "### Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "### Ans :-\n",
    "### What is the abc Module in Python?\n",
    "#### The abc module in Python stands for Abstract Base Classes. It is a module that provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs). ABCs are used to define a set of methods and properties that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract base class. A class that contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class, and it cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "### Why is the abc Module Used?\n",
    "#### The abc module is used for the following purposes:-\n",
    "#### (i)Defining Interfaces: It allows the creation of abstract base classes that can define interfaces for other classes. This ensures that certain methods are implemented in the subclasses, promoting a consistent interface.\n",
    "#### (ii)Enforcing Method Implementation: By defining abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator, the abc module ensures that derived classes implement these methods. This prevents the creation of incomplete implementations and helps in maintaining a consistent design.\n",
    "#### (iii)Promoting Code Reusability: Abstract base classes can provide some default implementations, which can be reused by subclasses, reducing code duplication.\n",
    "#### (iv)Enhancing Code Readability and Maintainability: By explicitly defining the intended structure and behavior of subclasses, ABCs make the code more readable and maintainable.\n",

    "### Why Can't We Instantiate Abstract Classes?\n",
    "#### (i)Incomplete Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared in the abstract class but not implemented. Since these methods lack implementation, creating an instance of the abstract class would result in an object with incomplete functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (ii)Design Intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes are designed to be inherited by other classes that provide concrete implementations of the abstract methods. They are intended to be used as a base for other classes, ensuring that certain methods are implemented in subclasses.\n",

    "### Correct Usage of Abstract Classes :-\n",
    "Abstract classes should be inherited by subclasses that implement the abstract methods. Here’s how to properly use abstract classes:"
