    "### Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or prototype for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific realization of the class blueprint with actual values for the attributes.\n",
    "#### Class :- \n",
    "####  (i) A class encapsulates data for the object.\n",
    "####  (ii) It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "####  (iii) It serves as a template to create multiple objects with similar properties and behaviors.\n",
    "#### Object :- \n",
    "####  (i) An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "####  (ii) It holds actual values for the attributes defined by the class.\n",
    "####  (ii) It can perform actions using the methods defined in the class."

    "### Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class.\n",
    "    - It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "    - Encapsulation is often achieved using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "    - Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class, known as a subclass or derived class, inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class, known as a superclass or base class.\n",
    "    - It allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "    - The subclass can add new attributes and methods, as well as override existing ones from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "    - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "    - It enables a single interface to represent different underlying data types.\n",
    "    - Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "    - Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n",
    "    - It simplifies the interaction with the object by providing a clear and simplified interface.\n",
    "    - Abstraction is often achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### These four pillars are fundamental concepts that define the structure and behavior of object-oriented programming languages and enable the design of robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems."

    "### Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### The __init__() function in Python is a special method called a constructor. It is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. The primary purpose of the __init__() method is to initialize the instance variables of the object. It allows the object to set its initial state by assigning values to the properties defined in the class.\n",
    "### Why __init__() is Used :-\n",
    "#### (i) Initialization: It sets up initial values for the attributes of the object.\n",
    "#### (ii) Parameterization: It allows the passing of parameters during object creation, making each object unique.\n",
    "#### (iii) Automatic Invocation: It ensures that initialization code is executed automatically when an object is created."

    "### Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access variables and methods that belong to the class instance. Here's why self is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (i)Instance Differentiation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "self allows each instance of a class to have its own unique set of attributes and methods. It differentiates between the instance variables of different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (ii)Attribute Access:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Using self, you can access and modify the attributes of the current object. It is used to bind the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (iii)Method Calling:-\n",
    "\n",
    "self is required to call other methods from within the same class. It ensures that the correct instance methods are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (iv)Clarity and Convention:-\n",
    "\n",

    "### Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (known as a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (known as a superclass or base class). This mechanism promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "### There are several types of inheritance in Python:\n",
    "#### (i)Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.\n",
    "#### (ii)Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from more than one superclass.\n",
    "#### (iii)Multilevel Inheritance:A subclass inherits from a superclass, which in turn inherits from another superclass.\n",
    "#### (iv)Hierarchical Inheritance:Multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass.\n",
    "#### (v)Hybrid Inheritance: In hybrid inheritance, a combination of more than one type of inheritance is used. Note that hybrid inheritance can sometimes lead to complexities like the Diamond Problem."
