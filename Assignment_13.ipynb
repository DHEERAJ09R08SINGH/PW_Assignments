    "\n",
    "1. **Find All Documents**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for doc in collection.find():\n",
    "       print(doc)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Retrieves and prints all documents in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Find Documents with a Specific Condition**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for doc in collection.find({'age': {'$gt': 30}}):\n",
    "       print(doc)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Finds and prints documents where the `age` field is greater than 30. `$gt` is a query operator that stands for \"greater than\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find Documents with Specific Fields (Projection)**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for doc in collection.find({}, {'name': 1, 'email': 1, '_id': 0}):\n",
    "       print(doc)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Retrieves documents with only the `name` and `email` fields included, and excludes the `_id` field. The first argument `{}` specifies no filter (all documents), while the second argument specifies the projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find Documents with Sorting and Limiting**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for doc in collection.find().sort('age', 1).limit(2):\n",
    "       print(doc)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Retrieves the top 2 youngest people by sorting documents by the `age` field in ascending order (`1` for ascending, `-1` for descending) and limiting the results to 2 documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find a Single Document**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   alice = collection.find_one({'name': 'Alice Smith'})\n",
    "   print(alice)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Retrieves a single document matching the condition where the `name` field is 'Alice Smith'. `find_one()` returns the first matching document or `None` if no document matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`find()`**: Retrieves documents that match the query criteria and returns a cursor for iteration.\n",
    "- **Query Operators**: Enable complex queries by specifying conditions.\n",
    "- **Projection**: Allows you to control which fields are included in the results.\n",
    "- **Sorting and Limiting**: Provides control over the order and number of documents returned.\n",

    "### Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "### Ans:-\n",
    "#### The `sort()` method in MongoDB is used to order the documents returned by a query based on one or more fields. Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `sort()` Method Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax**: `collection.find(query).sort(field_or_fields, direction)`\n",
    "  - **`query`**: The query filter to select documents (optional).\n",
    "  - **`field_or_fields`**: The field(s) to sort by.\n",
    "  - **`direction`**: The sorting order (`1` for ascending and `-1` for descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Field Sorting**:\n",
    "   - Sort documents based on a single field in either ascending or descending order.\n",
