    "### Why Do We Need Custom Exceptions?\n",
    "    (i)Clarity: Custom exceptions can provide more specific information about what went wrong, rather than using generic exceptions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (ii)Control: They allow you to handle different error conditions in a granular way.\n",

    "    (iii)Maintainability: Custom exceptions can help encapsulate error logic, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "    \n",
